            <p><strong>Class:</strong> ENTR 390</p>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 4 weeks</p>

        <div class = "project-section">
          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p> On a fall saturday unlike any other, I found myself in an extremely stressful situation - I 
            didn't have a ticket to tonight's Michigan football game. I had previously sold my ticket to my
            friend as I didn't think I was going to be able to go, but at the last moment, my schedule 
            cleared up. After scouring Facebook and getting scammed by a fake user I came to the conclusion:

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Finding a ticket to Michigan football games as a Michigan student takes a lot of time, effort, and energy from the buyer and seller perspective.</strong></p>
          </div>

        <div class = "project-section">
          <h3>Audience/Personas</h3>
          <p>
            
            In order to determine who my audience was, I brainstormed potential users of the product based
            on who would be able to relate to my problem statement. I brainstormed the following potential 
            users of my application.

            <br>
            <br>

            <ul class = "bulleted-list">
            <li>Michigan students who like to sell their tickets</li>
            <li>Michigan students who want to bring friends to the games</li>
            <li>Michigan students who donâ€™t know how to find student tickets</li> 
            <li>Michigan students who need tickets at the last minute and need a convenient way to find tickets</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p>From there, I assigned my primary and 2 secondary personas. I thought that the 
              buyer should be the primary persona because I believe the customer should always 
              be at the heart of the product. I then assigned my secondary personas to be sellers
              who are selling their tickets for different reasons.
              <br>
              <br>

              For my primary persona, I created an empathy map to really ensure that I was understanding
              the pain points.

            </div>
              
              <div class="empathy-map-container">
                <img id = "empathy-map" src="images/Empathy_Map.png" alt="Empathy Map">
              </div>
              
              <div class="project-section">

                <br>
                <br>

                <p>
                  I then used this empathy map to help me with my primary persona, and then created my 
                  two secondary personas.
                  Emily Morris represents the primary persona and the "buyer" archetype. <br>
                  Rashida Peterson and Josh Henderson represent secondary personas and the "seller" archetypes. <br> 
                </p>

              </div>
                

              

            </p>

          </p>

        <div class = "persona-images">
          <img id = "primary" src="images/Persona_1.png" alt="Primary Persona" class = "persona">
          <img src="images/Persona_2.png" alt="Secondary Persona" class = "persona">
          <img src="images/Persona_3.png" alt="Secondary Persona" class = "persona">
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="project-section">

          <h3>Design Process</h3>
  
          <p>
            After conducting my research, I settled on three outcomes I wanted my application to have. These included: <br><br>
  
            <ul class = "bulleted-list">
              <li><strong>Reduce scams/fake ticket transfers,</strong> allow reporting and blocking of dishonest users</li>
              <li>Allow users to easily <strong>find tickets</strong> to all games that they want to go to</li>
              <li>Create platform where users can easily <strong>keep track of all ticket related conversations</strong></li> 
            </ul>
  
            <br>
            <br>
  
            <p>Therefore, I knew my app needed the following key functions: <br><br></p>
  
            <ul class = "bulleted-list">
              <li>A home screen where you can easily find tickets</li>
              <li>The ability to report and block dishonest users</li>
              <li>A way to message other users safely and securely to conduct transations</li>
              <li>Allow users to post tickets to sell</li>  
            </ul>
  
            <br>
            <br>
  
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I started out by sketching my ideas and created a low fidelity version of what I wanted my user flow to be (seen below). <br><br>
          </p>

          <img src="images/arch-diagram.png" alt="Architechture diagram">
  
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            I then developed my wireframes in Balsamiq. Below are my wireframes for two key actions - communicating
            with the seller and posting a ticket. <br><br>
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <strong>Communicating with the seller</strong>
          </p>
  
          <div class="key-action">
            <img class = "action-step" src="images/Communicate_with_seller-1.png" alt="Communicating with the seller - step 1">
            <img class = "action-step" src="images/Communicate_with_seller-2.png" alt="Communicating with the seller - step 2">
            <img class = "action-step" src="images/Communicate_with_seller-3.png" alt="Communicating with the seller - step 3">
          </div>
  
          <p>
            <strong>Posting a ticket</strong>
          </p>
  
          <div class="key-action">
            <img class = "action-step" src="images/Post_Ticket-1.png" alt="Posting a ticket - step 1">
            <img class = "action-step" src="images/Post_Ticket-2.png" alt="Posting a ticket - step 2">
            <img class = "action-step" src="images/Post_Ticket-3.png" alt="Posting a ticket - step 3">
          </div>
  
          <p>
            I then moved into creating high-fidelity versions of these designs which can be seen below.
          </p>
    
          <div class="key-action">
            <img class = "action-step" src="images/Home_Screen_original.png" alt="First home screen">
            <img class = "action-step" src="images/post_ticket_original.png" alt="Posting a ticket">
            <img class = "action-step" src="images/messaging_original.png" alt="Messaging a seller">
          </div>
  
          <br>
          <br>
  
          <p>
            However, after receving feedback from my peers and instructors, I decided I really didn't like how my application looked at all.
            People thought the home screen had way too many tickets on it, and the app really did not have the polish that I wanted it to. I decided to
            rethink how I displayed tickets and create a new color scheme for the application altogether. <br><br>
          </p>
  
        </div>
  
        <div class="project-section">
          <h3>Iteration</h3>
  
          <p>
            After further iteration, I met with my instructors and my peers to discuss some two key questions that I had:
  
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <ul class = "bulleted-list">
              <li>Does my user flow make sense?</li>
              <li>Are the elements of the application readable?</li>
            </ul>
  
            <br>
  
            <p>
              I ended up making two critical changes based on this feedback. <br><br>
            </p>
  
            <p><strong>Change 1: Showing the current page</strong></p>
  
            <div class="key-action">
  
              <div class="picture-with-label">
                <img class = "action-step" src="images/Sell_Ticket_Old.png" alt="First home screen">
                <p>Old version</p>
              </div>
  
              <div class="picture-with-label">
                <img class = "action-step" src="images/Sell_Ticket_New.png" alt="First home screen">
                <p>New version</p>
              </div>
  
            </div>
  
            <p>
              <br>
              <br>
  
              Previously, my application did not display the current page if you opened the menu from the bottom. This
              was a concern as it could potentially throw off the flow of the user and it does not provide the user with
              enough knowledge when they need to navigate to another page. I added a stroke around the current page in the 
              menu so that users could use this as a visual indication of where they are in the application at the moment.
              <br>
              <br>
            </p>
  
            <p><strong>Change 2: Reformating the tickets screen</strong></p>
  
            <div class="key-action">
  
              <div class="picture-with-label">
                <img class = "action-step" src="images/My Tickets - OLD.png" alt="First home screen">
                <p>Old version</p>
              </div>
  
              <div class="picture-with-label">
                <img class = "action-step" src="images/My Tickets - Blocked Andrew.png" alt="First home screen">
                <p>New version</p>
              </div>
  
            </div>
  
            <p>
              <br>
              <br>

              My old tickets page utilized a small arrow to show whether you were selling or buying a ticket.
              Not only was this feature not clear to users (they did not know what the arrows meant), but it was an accessibility issue as it was not very large 
              and could've been hard to see by users with worse vision. To mitigate this, I created two explicit labels that 
              clearly defined what tickets users were buying and selling. I also seperated the two groups of tickets from each other. I decided to keep the arrows 
              on the tickets to reinforce the idea that the ticket was being sold and going "outward" or being bought and coming "inward".

        <div class="project-section">
          <h3>Rationale</h3>

          <p>

            I believe that I have created the best solution to my problem that finding and selling a Michigan football ticket requires a lot of effort from the buyer and 
            seller perspective. This is because my solution makes it faster to find the ticket while the user completes the transation through a third party.

            <br>
            <br>

            I was asked many times - wouldn't this application be better if you could just pay for the ticket in the application? My answer is a resounding <strong>no</strong>. <br><br>

            The goal of my application was to completely streamline the process of finding tickets to Michigan Football games, as 
            the current solutions that exist include combing through various groupchats and GroupMes, and selling tickets on less-than-trustworthy websites. Websites 
            where you can sell your tickets are not used by many people because people want credibility with services that handle financial transations - credibility that would be hard to establish 
            in a brand new application.
            I wanted to create an application that users could trust, and this meant NOT handling financial data and instead simply providing a platform for users to 
            find the tickets and the sellers/buyers they want. The ability to block and report users also ensure that this trust is kept while using the application.

            <br>
            <br>


            I was influenced by a number of different ticket applications including stubhub, seatgeek, and ticketmaster when I was creating this application. As established
            ticket selling giants, their user interfaces were inspirations to the way I displayed by tickets to my users. In addition, I used Apple fonts such as SF Pro and SF Pro Compact
            throughout the application because I felt that they gave a very polished look to the application that I was missing when I was using
            other fonts. 

          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="project-section">

          <h3>User Feedback</h3>

          <p>
            After receiving feedback from my instructors and peers, I can say with confidence that I achieved my goal of creating a 
            less painful and time-consuming way to find tickets to Michigan football games. Although there were a few errors and improvements I could make 
            to the interface, most people that I asked really resonated with the problem and saw this solution as one that addressed it well. As mentioned, a lot of 
            people expected to be able to pay for their tickets directly on the application. After explaining why I excluded the feature, they understood. 
            
            <br>
            <br>

            Many people mentioned that my application essentially abstracted out the search process when looking for tickets and got them straight to the bartering/messaging phase. This was a great comment to hear
            as it was what I believed to be the biggest bottleneck in the ticket process.

          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="project-section">

          <h3>Next Steps</h3>

          <p>
            My instructors were able to provide me with great feedback regarding what to improve about my application. They mentioned inconsistencies with the design language in my application
            (i.e "View Tickets" tab led to the home screen) and pointed out that the hamburger menu I use implies that the menu will swipe in from the right, when in reality, it comes from the bottom. They also
            mentioned areas where the readability of my application could have been improved by increasing font sizes and whitespace. 

            <br>
            <br>

            I made sure to take these lessons with me into my next project in ENTR 390, and I hope to do even better on that project.

            <br>
            <br>

            In terms of expansion, I would love to add features to use this application to buy basketball and hockey tickets. These tickets are also transferrable and 
            sought after, and therefore require work to find if you do not have season tickets.
